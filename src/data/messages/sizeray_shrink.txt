They've gotten so small, a giant could comfortably stuff them between their toes!
Their body is now so minute and dust-sized a single gentle kiss could crush them!
They're now shrunk so speckish that a single taste bud is like an island to them!
They've shrunk so tiny they can fit inside a tic tac box!
Now they're small enough to get lost in the toeprints of someone's sole!
They've gotten so small, they could be sucked from a drinking straw!
Now they're small enough to fit inside a shoe!
Now their body is smaller than a sesame seed!
Now they are the size of a lego figure!
Their body is now tiny enough to cover with a pinky finger!
They're now just as small and speckish as an ant!
