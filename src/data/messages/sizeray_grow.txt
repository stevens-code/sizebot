They've grown so huge that their feet sink into continents like sand!
They've grown so enormous their walk causes earthquakes!
They've grown so titanic they could crush the earth with their thighs!
They've grown so colossal the earth shakes when they speak!
They've grown so ginormous that entire civilizations could survive on their body!
They've grown so large townsfolk strain their neck to see them!
Their stomach gurgles are heard from miles away, the warmth of their breath affects the weather!
Entire cities feel like pebbles beneath their soles!
Now their body is so big buildings crumble when they lean on them!
They're now so huge they can pick up busses with one hand!
