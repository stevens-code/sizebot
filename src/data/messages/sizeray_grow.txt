They've grown so huge that their feet sink into continents like sand!
They've grown so enormous their walk causes earthquakes!
They've grown so titanic they could crush the earth with their thighs!
They've grown so colossal the earth shakes when they speak!
They've grown so ginormous that entire civilizations could survive on their body!
They've grown so large townsfolk strain their neck to see them!
Their stomach gurgles are heard from miles away, the warmth of their breath affects the weather!
Entire cities feel like pebbles beneath their soles!
Now their body is so big buildings crumble when they lean on them!
They're now so huge they can pick up busses with one hand!
They've become so big, so enormous, so *truly*, ***magnificently, tremendously MASSIVE***, that their head bumps into doorframes!
The very universe itself spreads before them like a twinkling desert, every grain of sand a galaxy tickling the grooves of their soles!
Regular people can just barely reach up to their ankles!
People, vehicles and buildings get pushed aside by their expanding body until they're laid across the entire city!
They can see their reflection across the entire face of a nearby skyscraper!
Mother Nature cannot compete with them as the tallest mountains stand around their knees!
The highest clouds drift around their hips and thighs while their toes tower over the tallest buildings!
They can straddle the entire planet like an exercise ball!
They can reach up and pluck the moon out the sky... What little sky remains uncovered by their tremendous form!
